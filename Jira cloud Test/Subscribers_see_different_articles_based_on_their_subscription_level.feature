Feature: Subscribers see different articles based on their subscription level 

Scenario: Free subscribers see only the free articles
  Given users with a free subscription can access "FreeArticle1" but not "PaidArticle1" 
  When I type "freeFrieda@example.com" in the email field
  And I type "validPassword123" in the password field
  And I press the "Submit" button
  Then I see "FreeArticle1" on the home page
  And I do not see "PaidArticle1" on the home page
